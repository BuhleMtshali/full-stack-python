### 📵 Mini PhoneBook CLI App (Day 8 – Full Stack Python Roadmap)

## 🧠 Project Description

This is a simple command-line PhoneBook application built in Python.
It allows users to view, add, and delete contacts stored as a list of tuples ((name, number)).
Perfect for practicing:

- Loops

- Functions

- Conditionals

- List manipulation

- User input validation

- Built as part of my Full-Stack Python Developer Roadmap (Day 8).


## 🚀 Features

- 📋 View all contacts with numbering

- ➕ Add contacts with:

    - Name validation (cannot be empty)

    - Phone number validation (must be at least 10 digits)

- 🗑 Delete contacts by name (case-insensitive)

- 🧼 Handles invalid inputs gracefully


- 🔄 Looped menu for multiple operations


## 🛠️ Tools & Concepts Used

- Python 3

- Functions for modular code

- Lists & tuples for data storage

- Loops (while & for)

- Conditionals (if/elif/else)

- String methods: .strip(), .lower(), .title()

- Input validation


## 📸 Example Run

```
===== 📵 Welcome To Your Mini PhoneBook ☎️ =====

1. View Contact List
2. Add Contact
3. Delete Contact
Choose an option: 1

====== Contact List ☎️ =======
List no. 1
Name: Buhle
Number: 0815905473

Wanna add another contact? (yes/no): yes

```

## 🔮 Possible Future Upgrades

- Search contacts by name or number

- Update existing contact details

- Save/load contacts from a .txt or .json file

- Prevent duplicate numbers from being added

- Add multiple phone numbers per contact

- Build a GUI version with Tkinter or PyQt

- Turn into a web app with Flask or Django


## 📁 How to Run It

1. Make sure Python 3 is installed:

```
python3 --version

```

2. Run the script:

```
python3 phonebook.py

```
