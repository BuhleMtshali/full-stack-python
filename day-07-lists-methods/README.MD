## 🛒 Mini Grocery List CLI App (Day 7 – Full Stack Python Roadmap)


## 🧠 Project Description

This is a simple, interactive command-line app where users can manage a grocery list — add, remove, search, and view items with a clean, user-friendly interface. Perfect for beginners learning about loops, conditionals, functions, and lists in Python.

This project was built as part of my Full-Stack Python Developer Roadmap (Day 7).


## 🚀 Features


✅ Add new grocery items

🗑️ Delete existing items

🔍 Search for items in the list

📋 View current cart (numbered display)

💬 Clean and fun user feedback with emojis

🧼 Handles invalid input gracefully


## 🛠️ Tools & Concepts Used


- Python 3

- while loops

- if/elif/else conditionals

- functions for modularity

- lists for data storage

- .strip() and .lower() for input sanitization


## 📸 Demo

```
===== 🍄 Welcome To My Mini Grocery List 🛒 =====

1. View Cart
2. Add Item
3. Delete Item
4. Search Item
5. Exit

Please choose an option (1–5): 2  
Enter the name of the item you want to add: apples  
✅ Apples has been successfully added to your cart.

Wanna make another operation? (yes/no): yes

```


## 🔮 Possible Future Upgrades

- Store items with quantities using a dictionary

- Add the ability to save/load from a file

- Option to clear the entire cart

- Create a GUI version using Tkinter or PyQt

- Build a web version with Flask or Django


## 📁 How to Run It

1. Make sure Python 3 is installed:

```
python3 --version

```

2. Run the script:

```
python3 grocery_list.py

```


## 🤓 Why This Project?

- Small projects like this one are great for:

    - Practicing input handling

    - Learning how to think through program flow

    - Getting comfortable with basic Python syntax

    - Building confidence in debugging and modular code
