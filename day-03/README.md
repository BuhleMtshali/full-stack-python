# 💰 Day 3 – Mini Tip Calculator

Welcome to the **Mini Tip Calculator**, where math meets manners 😌  
Ever been out with friends and the bill lands on the table like a final boss battle? This little Python script makes splitting the bill AND calculating the tip as easy as pie (or pizza 🍕).

---

## 🧠 What It Does

- Takes your **order total**

- Lets you choose a **tip percentage**

- Splits the bill between any number of people (even just you 🫠)

- Spits out a neat little **receipt** with all the details

Oh, and it loops too! Because sometimes we like to play with numbers before facing reality 😅

---

## 📦 Features

✅ Calculate tip amount based on order total  

✅ Add tip to the total  

✅ Divide the total among any number of people  

✅ Handles solo-bill guilt with humor 🫢  

✅ Loop to run multiple calculations (if you're *that* generous)
