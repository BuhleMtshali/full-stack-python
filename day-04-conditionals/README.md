# 📝 Mini Grade Checker

Welcome to **My Mini Grade Checker** – a simple Python project that calculates your final grade based on your marks and tells you exactly what letter grade you earned. Whether you're trying to figure out if you passed or just flex your A+, this one's for you. 🎓

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This mini-project is part of my **100 Days of Code** challenge – **Day 4**: Focused on conditional logic, user input, and basic arithmetic operations. It allows users to:

- Enter their name and module name.
- Input the marks they received and the total marks possible.
- Calculate the final percentage.
- Receive a friendly breakdown of their grade with personalized feedback.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 👤 Personalized messages using the student’s name
- 📈 Percentage calculation based on raw scores
- 🎯 Grade classification (A+ to F)
- 🧠 Simple, beginner-friendly Python logic
- 😄 Positive, encouraging messages for every outcome

---

## 🧠 What I Learned

- How to use `if-elif-else` statements effectively
- Performing calculations with floats
- String formatting for cleaner output
- Basic user input validation ideas (planning for future upgrades)

---

## 💻 How to Run It

1. Make sure you have Python installed.
2. Clone the repo or copy the script into a `.py` file.
3. Run it from your terminal or any Python IDE:

```bash

python grade_checker.py

```

4. Follow the prompts and get your grade!

## 🛠 Example Output

```

======= 📝 Welcome to My Mini Grade Checker ======
Enter your name 🙋🏻‍♀️: Buhle
Enter your Module Name 📔: Web Technologies
What was your mark for the module ✅: 75
What was the Module total 📇: 100

Okay Buhle, you got 75.0 in your Web Technologies which was out of 100.0,
and your final grade is: 75.00%.
👍 Congrats, you got a C

```

## 📚 Future Improvements

- Add input validation to catch typos and bad input

- Loop to allow checking grades for multiple modules

- Write results to a file for record-keeping

- Add emoji-based grading scale (just for vibes 😎)
